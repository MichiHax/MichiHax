## Hi! :3 🐱

I am a YouTuber that loves cats and is currently making Friday Night Funkin' content.
I used to publish Geometry Dash and Minecraft Cheating content but i don't do that anymore.

Main youtube channel (I don't post anymore): https://www.youtube.com/@MichiHax

Second youtube channel (Doing fnf stuff): https://www.youtube.com/@MichiHax2

Despite me being on GitHub I don't know how to code. Yes you red that right. I am on GitHub because its where the mayority of FNF Engines are.

I mainly use JS Engine by @JordanSantiagoYT (https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-JS-Engine)

And H-Slice engine by @HRK-EXEX (https://github.com/HRK-EXEX/H-Slice)
